# Reactive Cocoa test issue

This is a sample test that shows the problem I am facing when I want to test my ViewModel object that use a `RACCommand`.

Test target was left to its default settings. This means that tests are executed in the Host Application with _Allow testing Host Application APIs_ enabled.
